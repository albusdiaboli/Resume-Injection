Resume-Injection
This project is a Python script that lets you quietly inject custom metadata and invisible text into a PDF file (like a resume). It's designed for creative experimentation, watermarking, or embedding hidden recruiter cuesâ€”purely for educational or novelty purposes.

What Does It Do?
- Adds custom metadata to your PDF (like author, title, subject).
- Injects invisible text (white and tiny) onto the first few pages.
- Adds a small annotation with your message.
- Automatically saves the modified PDF to your Downloads folder (unless you choose a different path).

  How to Use:
  1. Clone the Repository
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Resume-Injection.git
     cd Resume-Injection
  2. Install Required Library
     pip install pymupdf
  3. Set Your PDF Path
     input_path = "add the file path"
