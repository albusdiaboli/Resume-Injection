# 🕵️ Resume-Injection

This project is a Python script that quietly enhances a PDF resume by injecting invisible text and custom metadata. It can be used for watermarking, tracking, embedding hidden cues for recruiters, or just for fun—purely for educational and personal use.

---

## 📌 What Does It Do?

* 📝 Adds **custom metadata** to your PDF (like author, title, and keywords).
* 👻 Injects **invisible white text** on the first few pages of the resume.
* 💬 Embeds a small **annotation** to increase text visibility in PDF processors.
* 📁 Saves the modified PDF to your **Downloads folder** by default.

## ⚙️ How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Resume-Injection.git
cd Resume-Injection
```

### 2. Install Required Library

Make sure you have [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) installed:

```bash
pip install pymupdf
```

### 3. Set Your PDF Path

Open the script and edit this line in `injector.py`:

```python
input_path = "add the file path"
```

Replace `"add the file path"` with the actual path to your PDF resume:

```python
input_path = "C:/Users/yourname/Documents/my_resume.pdf"
```

### 4. Run the Script

```bash
python injector.py
```

The enhanced version will be saved as `enhanced_resume.pdf` in your Downloads folder (or your custom output path if you set one).
